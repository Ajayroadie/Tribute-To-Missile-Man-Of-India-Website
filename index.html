                    <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 -27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                        scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born
                        and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the
                        next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                        Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                        involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
                        came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
                        missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                        political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
                        test by India in 1974.</p>
